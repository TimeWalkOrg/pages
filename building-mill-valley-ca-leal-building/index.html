<p>Constructed around the year 1890, this building was the biggest building in Mill Valley. It was three layers tall, housing several small stores on the bottom layer but conserving the top for small businesses and workplaces. Owned by Franke E. Lockwood from 1906 to 1936, it was considered among the largest business block in Mill Valley. It was bought by Mary Simpson Birnie in 1936 for $50,000, or the equivalent of approximately $940,000 today.</p>

<ul>
<li>We decided to base all of our measurements off of the wooden model in the Mill Valley History Room.</li>
<li>We had nothing to base color off of, so we looked at other buildings around it from the same time to get an idea of what colors it may be.</li>
