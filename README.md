# pages (web pages for TimeWalk building info)
Container for HTML pages hosted at https://pages.timewalk.org/

Each building has a dedicated webpage explaining its history and model construction.  This webpage is a copy of the Github README.md ("markdown format" file) for that building (e.g. the pages at https://github.com/TimeWalkOrg/pages/tree/master/building-mill-valley-ca-hub-theatre are an HTML-friendly version of the Github README at https://github.com/TimeWalkOrg/building-mill-valley-ca-hub-theatre).

To generate these web pages (e.g. for a new building), do the following:

- Visit the Github repo for the building
- Make sure the README.md displays correctly (i.e. no broken links, images appear)
- (Copy github pages into /pages directory?)
- Visit the site https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-md to convert the Github "markdown" format to HTML
- Upload all of the new /pages to pages.timewalk.org (using FTP or Now or whatever works)
- Test the pages
