<p>87 Throckmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941</p>
<h2 id="building-history">Building History</h2>
<p>In the 1920s, 87 Throckmorton Avenue was the home of Mill Valley’s Northwestern Pacific Railroad station. The building was previously located near the intersection of Sunnyside and Miller Avenues and it was moved to this site circa 1903. In addition to being a terminal for the Northwestern Pacific, the station was also the starting point for the Mt. Tamalpais &amp; Muir Woods Railway or the “Mountain Railway”. This scenic railway transported tourists on a winding journey to the summit of Mt. Tamalpais.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the railroad station featured a ticket office and a newsstand. On the second floor were living quarters for the station manager. Outside, a train shed protected passengers from the elements as they waited for trains. Over the years, the design of the building would change and when commuter train service ceased in 1940, the station would become a bus depot for Pacific Greyhound buses. In 2017, the building is the home of the Depot Bookstore &amp; Cafe.</p>

<h3 id="design-decisions-1920-version">Design Decisions (1920 Version)</h3>
<ul>
<li>We assumed that the street-level dimensions of the building corresponded to the Mill Valley Depot as of 2017 (25.25m x 10.25m)</li>
<li>We have left the exterior color white, though the HO-scale model in the Mill Valley Library History room suggests that it was yellow in color. We have no source for that assumption.</li>
<li>No photos of the interior of the Depot prior to 1929 have been found. The ticket area and upstairs quarters are based on similar train stations of the period.</li>
