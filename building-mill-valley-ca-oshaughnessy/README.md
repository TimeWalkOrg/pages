## Building History
"By 1893 The O'Shaughnessy building was built... looking very much as it does today. It operated as a hotel called, at various periods, the "Mill Valley House" and "Alpha Hotel" under different managements. The proprietor, Michael O'Shaughnessy , was the engineer who designed the Hetch Hetchy Dam, the Twin Peaks Tunnel in San Francisco and laid out the streets and lots for the Tamalpais Land and Water Company."
