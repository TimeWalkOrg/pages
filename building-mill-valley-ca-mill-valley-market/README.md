# Mill Valley Market
118-120 Throckmorton Ave., Mill Valley, CA 94941 (now referred to as "Branded Boutique")

# Building History
This building was built in 1898, and opened as the Mill Valley Market on July 4, 1929. The owners Frank and Kathe Canepa lived in the upstairs apartment. Jim Canepa, their son later suggested moving the store to its current location on Corte Madera Avenue; Jim Canepa took over the store from his parents and has expanded it into two adjacent buildings.  The old market became the Mill Valley Laundromat, and then the Mill Valley Hat Store in 1994.  In 2015, Branded Boutique, which sells women's clothes, took the place of the hat store and has since remained there.  This building has not undergone any major renovations and has maintained its integrity for over a century.
