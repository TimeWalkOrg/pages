# The Outdoor Art Club
38 Miller Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History
The Outdoor Art club was formed when a group of women in Mill Valley were upset
because of picnickers that were destroying plant life. The famous architect, Bernard Maybeck
was chosen by the club to design the building. The building is surrounded by beautiful foliage.

Some interesting facts about the Mill Valley Art Club: During WW1 and 2 the clubhouse was
given to the Red Cross for service. During the march for Women’s Suffrage, the club
worked to raise money for the movement. Today, the Outdoor Art Club is a social center for Mill
Valley. It’s rented out for weddings, parties and other social functions.
