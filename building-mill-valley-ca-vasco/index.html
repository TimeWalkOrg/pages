<p>&quot;The first lot sold at the auction of 1890 was located at the corner of Bernard and Throckmorton Avenues. It was leased as the site of a carpenter shop which was replaced by 1894 with a two story building crowned with a cupola that became Wheeler Martin's Pioneer Grocery. Martin was appointed postmaster in 1894 and the post office was moved to his store from the railroad station.&quot; Source: <a href="http://www.millvalleylibrary.net/historyroom/collections/archive/files/mvhs1984spring-reduce_910d348bce.pdf">Mill Valley Historical Society Review, Spring 1984</a></p>
