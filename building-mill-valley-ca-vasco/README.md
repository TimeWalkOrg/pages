## Building History

"The first lot sold at the auction of 1890 was located at the corner of Bernard and Throckmorton Avenues. It was leased as the site of a carpenter shop which was replaced by 1894 with a two story building crowned with a cupola that became Wheeler Martin's Pioneer Grocery.  Martin was appointed postmaster in 1894 and the post office was moved to his store from the railroad station."

## Future Edits
- Model is based on c1894 photo: look for 1920 versions to ensure accuracy
- Sign read "Roseveare & Allen" in 1920?
