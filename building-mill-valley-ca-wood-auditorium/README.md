# Wood Auditorium
700 Miller, Mill Valley, CA 94941 (now referred to as "Gus' Gym")

## Building History
Tam High was opened in 1908, at the time only 64 students attended and they were taught by a grand total of three teachers.  Wood Auditorium was built by students later, in 1919, due to expanding need for athletic facilities.  It was later named after George Gustafason, who coached football, swimming, and tennis for 37 years at Tam.  In 1972 the film "American Graffiti" was filmed in the gym.  During the 1990's and 2000's there were many renovations done to the gym.  The four towers were removed as well several of the large side windows.
