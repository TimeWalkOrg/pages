## Building History
Excerpt from a 2014 historic evaluation ([link here](http://cityofmillvalley.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=721&meta_id=31010)):

"The history of the Mill Valley Lumber property is integral to the history of the town of Mill Valley. 
Founded concurrent with the late-19th century origins of the town and located along one of Mill Valley's
two principal thoroughfares, the MVL site and its use have been familiar to generations of local
residents. The MVL is one of MV's oldest, largest and most durable commercial properties and
businesses. Even if most may never have entered the property, it is a longstanding commercial
landmark along Miller Avenue, signifying an aspect of the early and ongoing commercial character
of Mill Valle~ including the connection between the town and its region to the 19th century
lumber trade. Moreover, the MVL property is integrally associated both with Corte Madera
Creek and with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad, the courses of which were manifest in the
original and early form of the property and its structures."
